# SQLantern integration into CMS (modules/plugins)

As soon as [SQLantern](https://github.com/nekto-kotik/sqlantern) gets released, this repository will be filled, as well.

The initial release will contain an OpenCart module (OCMOD for v2.3 and v3.x) and a Joomla plugin (for v3.x, v4.x), as `zip` files and source code.
OpenCart v4 module will be added later.

I plan to also make a WordPress plugin later.
